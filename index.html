                Hello, my names is Julius Conaway and I am enrolled in Rutgers Coding Boot Camp aspiring to
                use code to change the world. I am a 32 year old man with 4 children in which 2 are 5 month old
                twins. I know what youâ€™re thinking, what kind of mad man goes back to school with a set of
                newborn twins and 2 more growing boys? Well I would like to answer that question with one of my
                own. If a bumble bee,<p>aerodynamically doesn't have wings big enough to lift it's body how does it fly?
                The answer is because it has to! If bumble bees didn't fly there would be a shortage of pollination.
                Which would in undoubtedly disrupt the worlds ecological balance. No matter how hard or unlikely it
                must. Staying on the ground is not an option so if you have to go against your ability to be comfortable,
                reason, and practicality to fly then you DO. I am from a place where the people in masses can only struggle
                to survive or die, but no one really lives. I am striving to change all that for my hometown of
                Newark, NJ. I was raised by a single mother and never had a relationship with my biological father
                which is pretty much the norm where I am from but this is just another obstacle I believe can be
                overcome using code. I graduated from one of the top high schools in Newark at the time, Science
                Park High School, at the age of 16 years old and was in college by the age of 17. Life has been
                a roller coaster ride and I believe it has yet to climb to the heights that code will take it to.
                As far as work goes I am currently employed with Westrock International, a corrugated paper plant,
                and a member of the Steel Workers Union in Newark. I have been recognized for my stellar work ethic 
                although I am defintiley ready to "jump off the hamster wheel"! I believe throught code I will do just
                that.
